    <h1>HAPPY PROPOSE DAY &#128141;</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Hey you… yes, YOU 😌
    </p>
    <p>I don’t know if it’s Propose Day or just another excuse to flirt with you shamelessly, but here I am thinking about you again. (Surprise? Not really)</p>
    <p>Tell me one thing</p>
    <p>how do you manage to look this cute even from miles away?</p>
    <p>Because honestly, distance is doing a terrible job of keeping me from falling harder for you every single day.</p>
    <p>Sometimes I try to act normal…
        then you text me,
        and suddenly I’m smiling like an idiot at my phone,
        checking if my heartbeat is doing cardio again.
        (Pretty sure it is are you my crush or my personal gym trainer? 😏)</p>
        <p>They say long-distance love needs trust, patience, and effort.
            But nobody warned me it would also come with
            constant butterflies, late-night cravings for you, and an unhealthy urge to pull you closer every time I miss you.</p>
            <p>If I had a rupee for every time I thought about you,
                I’d buy a ticket, break the distance,
                and say this to you in person
                but since I can’t right now, let me say it from my heart 💗</p>
                <p>I like you.</p>
                <p>No scratch that.</p>
                <p>I want you.</p>
                <p>I want your good mornings, your sleepy voice,
                    your bad days, your random moods,
                    your laughs that make my day better,
                    and even your silence—because somehow, it feels comforting when it’s you.</p>
                    <p>If flirting with you was a crime, I’d happily serve a life sentence.</p>
                    <p>Because damn… every conversation with you feels like chemistry,
                        and I’m tired of pretending it’s not 😌🔥
                        So here’s me, officially and unapologetically asking</p>
                        <h1>Will you be mine?</h1>
                        <p>Not just as a label,</p>
                        <p>but as my favorite notification,</p>
                        <p>my safe place,</p>
                        <p>my biggest flex,</p>
                        <p>and the reason I believe distance doesn’t stand a chance.</p>
                        <p>Because let’s be honest…</p>
                        <p>this distance?</p>
                        <p>Temporary</p>
                        <p>My feelings for you?</p>
                        <p>Very permanent. 💋</p>
                        <p>Waiting for the day I can steal your hoodies and your heart</p>
                        <p>HONEYYY  💖</p>
