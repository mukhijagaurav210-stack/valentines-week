    <h1>HAPPY ROSE DAY&#127801;</h1>

        <p>My Love, 🌹
            On this Rose Day, I wish I could place a rose in your hands instead of words on a screen… but until then, let these words carry my feelings to you.</p>
      <p>You’re my favorite thought when I wake up and my calm when the day feels heavy. Every time I smile without reason, somehow it’s always because of you. Loving you feels easy, natural like my heart already knew you before we met.</p>
       <p>They say roses fade with time, but what I feel for you only grows deeper. If love had a fragrance, it would smell like you. If love had a color, it would blush every time you smile.</p>
      
       <p>Here’s a little secret</p>
     <p>If I were a rose, I’d choose to grow in your garden forever 🌹</p>
     <p>Because being close to you is where I bloom the most.</p>
     <h1>Pick up Lines Rizzzz.... hehehe</h1>
     <p>Are you a rose? Because my heart gets thorns just trying to protect you.</p>
     <p>Are you magic? Because every time I see your name, my mood changes instantly.</p>
     <p>If love were a crime, I’d happily serve a lifetime sentence with you.</p>
     <br>
     <p>Thank you for being my safe place, my happiness, my soft moment in a loud world. I don’t just want roses with you today—I want all my tomorrows with you.
        Happy Rose Day, my beautiful reason to smile 💖
       </p>
       <p> Always yours,</p>
       <p>HONEYYY</p>
