    <h1>HAPPY HUG DAY &#129730;</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
   <p>Happy Hug day My Babyy Monster&#129782;</p>
   <p>If I could, I would steal you right now for the tightest, longest hug ever. Not the side hug type. Not the formal one. I’m talking about that slow, warm</p>
   <p>Pull you closer and don’t let go kind of hug… where the world disappears and it’s just you and me breathing in the same moment Hehehe</p>
   <p>You know what I love about hugs?</p>
   <p>They say everything without saying anything</p>
   <p>They say “I’m here.”
    They say “You’re safe.”
    They say “You’re mine… and I’m not letting you go that easily”</p>
    <p>And honestly? When I'll hug you, I don’t just feel cute or romantic… I feel calm Like my overthinking brain finally shuts up for two minutes One proper hug from you and I’ll forget all my attitude and become soft only for you </p>
    <p>If you hug me too tight, don’t blame me if I refuse to leave I might just stay there and say, “This is my home now”</p>
    <p>I promise you this on Hug Day:
        Whenever life gets heavy, I’ll be your tightest hug.
        Whenever you feel low, I’ll hold you till you smile.
        Whenever you’re happy, I’ll hug you even tighter just to celebrate you.</p>
        <p>Not now bcz we are far away but in the future ofc... hehehe</p>
        <p>And yes… sometimes I’ll hug you for no reason at all. Just because I can. Just because I want to feel your heartbeat next to mine and annoy you by not letting go Hehehe</p>
        <p>You’re not just someone I like.
            You’re someone I want to protect, tease, cuddle, laugh with, and hold close forever.</p>
   
   <p>I Love You Sooo Much&#128149; </p>
   <p>Forever Yours</p>
   <p>Honeyyyy</p>
