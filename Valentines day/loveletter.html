           <p>Heyy my monster babyyy ❤️
        </p>
        <p>Happy Valentine’s Day my favorite human ,  my favorite notification in this whole world. I know we’re miles apart, but tell me why it still feels like you’re holding my hand every single day? Maybe that’s what real love does… it doesn’t care about distance.
        </p>
<p>I miss you in the smallest things  playing games with you, annoying you with my bad jokes, hearing your voice when I’m half asleep. Sometimes I just stare at our chats and smile like an idiot. You’ve literally become my daily habit… and I don’t even want to quit.
</p>
<p>How are you this cute and still this dangerous? are you trying to steal my heart permanently or what? Because congratulations, mission successful. I’m gone. Fully yours. No refund, no return policy. 😌</p>
<p>There are days when distance feels hard, but then I remember… we’re not just surviving it, we’re proving that what we have is stronger than it. Every “good morning” and “good night” from you feels like a hug through the screen. One day, I won’t have to imagine it I’ll just pull you close and never let go.</p>
<p>Thank you for loving me, for choosing me, for being my chaos and my calm at the same time. You’re not just my Valentine today… you’re my always.</p>
<p>I love you more than my ego, more than my sleep, and that says a lot.</p>
<p>Forever Yours</p>
<p>Honeyyy &#128523;</p>
