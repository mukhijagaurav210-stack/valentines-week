   <p>Happy Kiss day My Babyy Monster&#129782;</p>
   <p>If distance had a face I would prolly kiss it just to make it disappear… because honestly, being this far from you on Kiss Day feels illegal. How is it even allowed that your lips are miles away from mine? This is unfair </p>
   <p>I swear, if kisses could travel through the screen, your phone would overheat by now</p>
   <p>You know what I realized?</p>
   <p>My lips are unemployed… because their dream job is kissing you. And they’re patiently waiting for the joining date. 😏</p>
   <p>Sometimes I close my eyes and imagine that soft, slow, “I missed you so much” kind of kiss. The one that starts sweet… stays a little longer than planned… and makes both of us forget the world for a second. That kind of kiss that says I’m yours without even speaking.
    </p>
   <p>Are you secretly a magician? Because every time you smile, I feel like kissing you through the screen</p>
   <p>Or maybe you’re just my favorite addiction… the only one I never want to quit</p>
   <p>Long distance is hard, I won’t lie. There are nights when I wish I could just pull you closer, hold your face gently, and give you that forehead kiss that makes you feel safe… then a cheek kiss just because you’re cute… and then maybe one more because I have zero self-control around you. 😌</p>
   <p>But until I can do that for real, here’s what I promise:
    One day, when we finally meet, I’m not just giving you one kiss.</p>
    <p>I’m giving you all the saved ones.</p>
    <p>The “good morning” kisses.</p>
    <p>The “I’m proud of you” kisses.</p>
    <p>The “I missed you like crazy” kisses.</p>
    <p>The "good night" kisses.</p>
    <p>And maybe a few naughty ones that I’m not writing here because I want to whisper them in your ear instead. 😉</p>
    <p>You’re not just someone I want to kiss.
        You’re someone I want to kiss after fights, after long days, after laughter, after tears.</p>
        <p>Bcz for me, a kiss from you isn’t just physical… it’s comfort, it’s reassurance, it’s home.</p>
        <p>So today on Kiss Day, I’m sending you the softest virtual kiss on your forehead… a playful one on your cheek… and one that lingers just a little on your lips.
            Close your eyes and feel it.</p>
   <p>I Love You Sooo Much&#128149; </p>
   <p>MWAHHHHHHH &#128139;</p>
   <p>Forever Yours</p>
   <p>Honeyyyy</p>
